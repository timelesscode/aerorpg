Aero Wars - Chapter 1: The Calm Before

Aero Wars
Chapter 1: The Calm Before
The neon lights of New Vegas Station pulsed against the backdrop of swirling nebulae, casting multicolored shadows across the chrome-plated docking bays. Six Aeros, sleek as silver bullets, lined up at the starting line of the infamous Ring of Saturn track. Their pilots weren't supposed to be racing here—illegal gambling had been banned since the Centauri Accord—but that never stopped anyone in the outer rings.

"Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen!" called out Jin "Lucky" Martinez, his mechanical arm shuffling a deck of Tonk cards with impossible speed. The crowd of humans and aliens pressed forward, credit chips clinking. "Tonight's special: double or nothing if you can beat me at dice after the race!"

In Bay 6, Aria Chen performed her pre-race ritual, running her hands along the smooth hull of her Aero, the "Star Drifter." At twenty-two, she was already legendary in the underground racing circuit, though few knew her true identity as a former Terran Military Academy prodigy.

"You sure about this, kid?" growled her co-pilot, a gruff Martian named Brick. His red skin was covered in tribal tattoos that told the story of his exile from the Martian High Council. "Something feels off tonight."

Aria adjusted her neural interface headband. "When has that ever stopped us?"

From the VIP lounge, three figures watched the proceedings with varying degrees of interest:

Dr. Sarah Blackwood, a brilliant but eccentric xenobiologist, scribbled notes about the betting patterns. Her theory that gambling behaviors transcended species boundaries was considered radical by her peers. Her companion, a towering Andromedian named K'thor, remained stoically silent, his crystalline skin refracting the neon lights.

Between them sat Zephyr Wade, a former Aero champion turned bounty hunter. He nursed a drink while his cybernetic eye scanned the crowd, tracking known criminals and potential marks. "Sarah, your algorithm's picking up that weird energy signature again."

In the shadows of Bay 13, Nova—a mysterious pilot whose species was unknown even to themselves—ran diagnostic checks on their Aero, "Phantom Eclipse." Their adoptive sister, Maya, a teenage hacking prodigy, typed furiously on a holographic keyboard.

"Nova, I'm detecting unauthorized military-grade scanning sweeps," Maya whispered. "Someone's looking for something. Or someone."

Before Nova could respond, the station's warning klaxons began to blare. The massive viewscreen above the track crackled to life, showing a face that made the blood drain from Aria's face.

Admiral Voss of the Terran Fleet—her former mentor—stared down at the crowd with cold, augmented eyes. His silver hair and scarred face marked him as a veteran of the First Contact War, but the hatred in his expression was something new.

"Citizens of the Allied Systems," his voice boomed. "For too long, we have allowed alien races to infiltrate our society, to corrupt our values with their degenerate cultures. Today, that ends. The Pure Human Movement begins now."

The screen went dark. In the terrible silence that followed, the first explosions began.

Aria's hand found her Tonk deck—her lucky charm. The top card showed the Fool, dancing on the edge of a cliff.

"Brick," she said quietly, "I don't think this is about racing anymore."

In the VIP lounge, Zephyr's cybernetic eye picked up multiple incoming warships dropping out of hyperspace. Sarah's alien behavior algorithms were screaming warnings. K'thor's crystalline skin began to pulse with ancient Andromedian war rhythms.

And in Bay 13, Nova felt something they hadn't experienced in their mysterious past: recognition. They knew that face. They knew why they'd been running all these years.

The civil war had begun. And these eight souls—human, alien, and everything in between—were about to discover their destinies were linked in ways none of them could have imagined.

The race would have to wait. Tonight, they would need to choose sides in a conflict that would reshape the galaxy.

Maya looked up from her holo-screen, her young face grave. "Nova... I found something. About who you really are. About what Admiral Voss is really after."

But that would have to wait. The first missiles were already streaking toward New Vegas Station, leaving trails of fire against the star-filled sky.
